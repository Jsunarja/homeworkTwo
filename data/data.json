I am just so beat with coding right now that I just don't want to touch my computer anymore. But I will just add these last few things and turn it in because I don't want to do this homework anymore. There isn't a problem with actually doing it. Its just that there needs to be so much content that I can't think of anything anymore. I might lose some points on professionalism but there isn't anymore information that I can cover. <br> <br> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adipisicing elit.

She doesn't like to write an about me so I am just going to write some jibberish. It may be even lorem ipsum, but I don't know. <br> <br> Over time I hope to have a whole site that I did from start to finish of the semester. There is a lot of things that I need to add and this isn't going to be the best thing in the world. I think that If continuously add to the pages and try to adapt the past homework to the next will help me build something that I may be able to add to my portfolio. <br> <br> I can't think of anything else for this section but I am just writing extra stuff so that the content is filled up. The last page, the product page, just took way to long and I didn't do it the best way it should have been. Especiall with the sass. There is a lot of repetative styles that I could have maybe used the BEM model in order to make it all better. I was just stressed and just tried to make the pages. </p> </div> <div class=\"aboutContentThree\"> <div class=\"aboutCatImg\"></div> <div class=\"aboutContentText\"> <h1>This Is Our Cat</h1> <p>Here is a picture of our cat. Her name is rosie and we got her last July. She was abandoned by her mother and we picked her up trying to cross US 40. She was so small when we first got her but now she is so big. <br> <br> I can't think of any more information to put into my pages so most of the site is going to just be jibberish. Most of the text is going to be lorem ipsum because I am lazy and I didn't spend a lot of time thinking of certain content. Most of this was done the night before it was due anyways so I am just trying to fill up the sections. <br> <br> On the topic of small rants, I think that some of this content that we need to get done is a little too much even for being an intermediate course. There is a lot that needs to get done for one week of work. Maybe if it was spread into two weeks I wouldn't be as stressed doing this work. </p> </div> </div> <div class=\"aboutContentFour\"> <h1>Just A Block Of Text Here</h1> <p>The rest of this page is just going to be lorem ipsum. I can't think of anymore information to put into the page so the last bit is going to be jibberish. <br> <br> Lorem ipsum dolor, sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.
